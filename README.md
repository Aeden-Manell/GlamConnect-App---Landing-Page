## Group Capstone Project "GlamConnect" - Aeden Manell & Zoe Dube

Welcome to the GlamConnect Landing Page repository! This project is part of our group capstone project for building a landing page for an Uber-like beauty services app. The goal is to create an enticing and informative page using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to showcase our skills in front-end web development, particularly in creating responsive landing pages using Bootstrap. By working collaboratively in pairs, we aim to deliver a visually appealing and user-friendly landing page for the GlamConnect mobile app.

## Requirements

To meet the project goals, we have outlined the following requirements:

1. Design: We will utilize our creativity and current skillset in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to design an attractive and visually cohesive GlamConnect landing page. We will ensure that the design elements align with the app's branding and target audience.

2. Responsiveness: The landing page must be responsive and adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. It should provide an optimal user experience regardless of the device being used.

3. Content: We will carefully curate suitable content to effectively showcase the app's features, benefits, and functionality. The content will be engaging, concise, and visually appealing to capture the attention of potential users.

4. Forms: The landing page will include user-friendly forms that allow visitors to sign up and create an account. These forms will be designed to be intuitive and easy to fill out, encouraging users to take action.

5. Navigation: To enhance user experience, the landing page will feature smooth navigation with links to different sections of the page. This will allow visitors to explore the various aspects of the GlamConnect app effortlessly.
